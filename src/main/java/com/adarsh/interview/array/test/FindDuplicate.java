//Java code Find duplicates in O(n) time and O(1) extra space
/**
 * Given an array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any
 * of these numbers appearing any number of times. Find these repeating numbers
 * in O(n) and using only constant memory space.
 * 
 * For example, let n be 7 and array be {1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 6, 6}, the answer should
 * be 1, 3 and 6.
 * 
 * 
 * Method 1 and Method 2 of the above link are not applicable as the question
 * says O(n) time complexity and O(1) constant space. Also, Method 3 and Method
 * 4 cannot be applied here because there can be more than 2 repeating elements
 * in this problem. Method 5 can be extended to work for this problem. Below is
 * the solution that is similar to the Method 5.

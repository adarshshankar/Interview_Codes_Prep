 * Count frequencies of all elements in array in O(1) extra space and O(n) time
 * Given an unsorted array of n integers which can contain integers from 1 to n.
 * Some elements can be repeated multiple times and some other elements can be
 * absent from the array. Count frequency of all elements that are present and
 * print the missing elements.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 3, 2, 5} Output: Below are frequencies of all elements
 * 1 -> 0 2 -> 2 3 -> 2 4 -> 0 5 -> 1
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {4, 4, 4, 4} Output: Below are frequencies of all elements 1
 * -> 0 2 -> 0 3 -> 0 4 -> 4 We strongly recommend that you click here and
 * practice it, before moving on to the solution.
 * 
 * A Simple Solution is to create a count array of size n as the elements are in
 * range from 1 to n. This solution works in O(n) time, but requires O(n) extra
 * space.
 * 
 * How to do it in O(1) extra space and O(n) time?
 * 
 * Below are two methods to solve this in O(n) time and O(1) extra space. Both
 * method modify given array to achieve O(1) extra space.
 * 
 * Method 1 (By making elements negative)
 * 
 * The idea is to traverse the given array, use elements as index and store
 * their counts at the index. For example, when we see element 7, we go to index
 * 6 and store the count. There are few problems to handle, one is the counts
 * can get mixed with the elements, this is handled by storing the counts as
 * negative. Other problem is loosing the element which is replaced by count,
 * this is handled by first storing the element to be replaced at current index.
 * 
 * Algorithm: 1) Initialize i as 0 2) Do following while i < n
 * 
 * // If this element is already processed, // then nothing to do a) If arr[i]
 * <= 0 i++; continue the loop from beginning
 * 
 * // Find index corresponding to this element // For example, index for 5 is 4
 * b) elementIndex = arr[i]-1;
 * 
 * // If the elementIndex has an element that is not // processed yet, then
 * first store that element // to arr[i] so that we don't loose anything. c) if
 * (arr[elementIndex] > 0) (i) arr[i] = arr[elementIndex];
 * 
 * // After storing arr[elementIndex], change it // to store initial count of
 * 'arr[i]' (ii) arr[elementIndex] = -1;
 * 
 * d) else // If this is NOT first occurrence of arr[i], // then increment its
 * count. (i) arr[elementIndex]--;
 * 
 * // And initialize arr[i] as 0 means the element // 'i+1' is not seen so far
 * (ii) arr[i] = 0; (iii) i++;
 * 
 * 3) Now -arr[i] stores count of i+1. Below is the implementation of the above
 * approach.
 * 
 * 
 * How does above program work? Let us take below example to see step by step
 * processing of above program: arr[] = {2, 3, 3, 2, 5}
 * 
 * i = 0, arr[i] = 2, arr[] = {2, 3, 3, 2, 5} Since arr[i] > 0, find
 * elementIndex. elementIndex = arr[i] – 1 = 2 – 1 = 1, arr[elementIndex] or
 * arr[1] is 3 Since arr[elementIndex] is postive, arr[i] = arr[elementIndex] =
 * 3 arr[elementIndex] = -1 // 2 is seen 1 times so far i is not changed.
 * 
 * i = 0, arr[i] = 3, arr[] = {3, -1, 3, 2, 5} Since arr[i] > 0, find
 * elementIndex. elementIndex = arr[i] – 1 = 3 – 1 = 2 arr[elementIndex] or
 * arr[2] is 3 Since arr[elementIndex] is postive arr[i] = arr[elementIndex] = 3
 * arr[elementIndex] = -1 // 3 is seen 1 times so far i is not changed.
 * 
 * i = 0, arr[i] = 3, arr[] = {3, -1, -1, 2, 5} Since arr[i] > 0, find
 * elementIndex. elementIndex = arr[i] – 1 = 3 – 1 = 2 arr[elementIndex] or
 * arr[2] is -1 Since arr[elementIndex] is negative arr[elementIndex] =
 * arr[elementIndex] – 1 = -2 // 3 is seen 2 times so far arr[i] = 0 // 1 is
 * not seen so far i is incremented
 * 
 * i = 1, arr[i] = -1, arr[] = {0, -1, -2, 2, 5} Since arr[i] is negative,
 * increment i
 * 
 * i = 2, arr[i] = -2, arr[] = {0, -1, -2, 2, 5} Since arrh[i] is negative,
 * increment i
 * 
 * i = 3, arr[i] = 2, arr[] = {0, -1, -2, 2, 5} Since arr[i] > 0, we find
 * elementIndex. elementIndex = arr[i] – 1 = 2 – 1 = 1 arr[elementIndex] or
 * arr[1] is -1 Since arr[elementIndex] is negative arr[elementIndex] =
 * arr[elementIndex] – 1 = -2 // 2 is seen 2 times so far arr[i] = 0 // 4 is
 * not seen so far i is incremented
 * 
 * i = 4, arr[i] = 5, arr[] = {0, -2, -2, 0, 5} Since arr[i] > 0, we find
 * elementIndex. elementIndex = arr[i] – 1 = 5 – 1 = 4 arr[elementIndex] or
 * arr[4] is 5 Since arr[elementIndex] is postive arr[i] = arr[elementIndex] = 4
 * arr[elementIndex] = -1 // 5 is seen 1 times so far i is not changed.
 * 
 * i = 1, arr[i] = -1, arr[] = {0, -2, -2, 0, -1} Since arr[i] is negative,
 * increment i

/**
 * Minimum sum of two numbers formed from digits of an array
 * 
 * Input: [6, 8, 4, 5, 2, 3] Output: 604 The minimum sum is formed by numbers
 * 358 and 246
 * 
 * Input: [5, 3, 0, 7, 4] Output: 82 The minimum sum is formed by numbers 35 and
 * 047
 * 
 * 1) A minimum number will be formed from set of digits when smallest digit
 * appears at most significant position and next smallest digit appears at next
 * most significant position ans so on..
 * 
 * 2) The idea is to sort the array in increasing order and build two numbers by
 * alternating picking digits from the array. So first number is formed by
 * digits present in odd positions in the array and second number is formed by
 * digits from even positions in the array. Finally, we return the sum of first
 * and second number.
 * 
 * The Class MinimumPossibleSumofTwoNumber.

/**
 * Given an array of n positive integers and a number k. Find the minimum number
 * of swaps required to bring all the numbers less than or equal to k together.
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {2, 1, 5, 6, 3}, k = 3 Output: 1
 * 
 * Explanation: To bring elements 2, 1, 3 together, swap element '5' with '3'
 * such that final array will be- arr[] = {2, 1, 3, 6, 5}
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {2, 7, 9, 5, 8, 7, 4}, k = 5 Output: 2
 * 
 * ####################################################################### A
 * simple solution is to first count all elements less than or equals to k(say
 * �good�). Now traverse for every sub-array and swap those elements whose value
 * is greater than k. Time complexity of this approach is O(n2)
 * 
 * A simple approach is to use two pointer technique and sliding window.
 * 
 * Find count of all elements which are less than or equals to �k�. Let�s say
 * the count is �cnt� Using two pointer technique for window of length �cnt�,
 * each time keep track of how many elements in this range are greater than �k�.
 * Let�s say the total count is �bad�. Repeat step 2, for every window of length
 * �cnt� and take minimum of count �bad� among them. This will be the final
 * answer.

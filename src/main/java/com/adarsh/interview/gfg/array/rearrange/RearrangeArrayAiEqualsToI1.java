/**
 * Rearrange an array such that arr[i] = i
 * 
 * Given an array of elements of length N, ranging from 0 to N � 1. All elements
 * may not be present in the array. If element is not present then there will be
 * -1 present in the array. Rearrange the array such that A[i] = i and if i is
 * not present, display -1 at that place.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * Input : arr = {-1, -1, 6, 1, 9, 3, 2, -1, 4, -1} Output : [-1, 1, 2, 3, 4,
 * -1, 6, -1, -1, 9]
 * 
 * Input : arr = {19, 7, 0, 3, 18, 15, 12, 6, 1, 8, 11, 10, 9, 5, 13, 16, 2, 14,
 * 17, 4} Output : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
 * 17, 18, 19]
 * 
 * 
 * 1. Nav�i�gate the array.
 * 
 * 2. Check if a[i] = -1, if yes then ignore it.
 * 
 * 3. If a[i] != -1, Check if element a[i] is at its cor�rect posi�tion
 * (i=A[i]). If yes then ignore it. 4. If a[i] != -1 and ele�ment a[i] is not at
 * its cor�rect posi�tion (i!=A[i]) then place it to its correct posi�tion, but
 * there are two conditions:
 * 
 * Either A[i] is vacate, means A[i] = -1, then just put A[i] = i . OR A[i] is
 * not vacate, means A[i] = x, then int y=x put A[i] = i. Now, we need to place
 * y to its cor�rect place, so repeat from step 3.

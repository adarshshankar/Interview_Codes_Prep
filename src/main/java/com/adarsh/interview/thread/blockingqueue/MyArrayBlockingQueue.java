/**
 * http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/blocking-queues.html
 * 
 * A blocking queue is a queue that blocks when you try to dequeue from it
 * and the queue is empty, or if you try to enqueue items to it and the queue is already full.
 * A thread trying to dequeue from an empty queue 
 * is blocked until some other thread inserts an item into the queue. 
 * A thread trying to enqueue an item in a full queue is blocked until some other thread
 * makes space in the queue,
 * either by dequeuing one or more items or clearing the queue completely.
